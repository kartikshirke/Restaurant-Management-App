## Bob's Restaurant App

For this assessment I have created a small App that will help Bob manage his restaurant. No need for a login system. The App features include:

* A list of who is working each day of the week
* A display of who's working on the current day (when I view in my browser)
* A way to edit employee schedules
* A way to create, update, and delete users
* The ability to view, edit, create and delete burgers-of-the-day
* Display the burger-of-the-day for each day of the week
* In a larger font somewhere, the current day's burger-of-the-day
* A way for Bob to set the burger of the day for each day of the week
* A creative and engaging UI/UX

## Requirements

I have used modern version of React. This App was bootstrapped with CRA (Create React App). 


## Getting Started

To get started, just run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The API is powered by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Refer to `json-server`'s documentation for how to query, edit, delete and create new records. 

The webserver can be accessed at:
